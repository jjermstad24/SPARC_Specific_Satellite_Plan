Welcome to InstruPy's documentation!
=====================================

Welcome! This is the documentation for InstruPy, last updated 7 Feb, 2022.

The recommended way to get started, is to first read through the User Guide (install and run the example). 
While setting up simulations with specific instruments, refer to the documentation of the instrument type available in :ref:`Instrument Models<instrument_models_desc>`
and :ref:`API Reference<api_reference>`. The API reference also provides examples.

The :ref:`Use Cases<use_cases>` section outlines example simulation scripts available in the ``examples`` folder for different applications of the InstruPy package. 
The :ref:`Miscellaneous<miscellaneous>` section has writeup about the miscellaneous concepts such as Reference frames, types of FOV, side-looking instruments and maneuverability.
The :ref:`Development<development>` section contains software development notes including description of validation tests.
