Passive Optical Scanner Model
******************************
The passive optical scanner model can be used to handle sensors with detector arrays operating at Visible and near-Visible (IR and UV) wavelengths. The formulation
of the sensor model is based on [1]. While [1] concentrates on an IR sensor, the formulation has been extended to optical sensors in [2]. 

sceneFOV/ FOR can be configured in the model, from which the coverage calculations (using the OrbitPy package) can be carried out to find the locations accessed on the ground.

   Diagram of rectangular aperture illustrating the input parameters :code:`numberDetectorRows`, :code:`numberDetectorCols` and :code:`detectorWidth`.

Note that only rectangular FOV is supported for this sensor type.
When the ``SENSOR_BODY_FIXED`` frame is aligned to the ``NADIR_POINTING`` frame, the instrument ``fieldOfViewGeometry.angleHeight`` corresponds to the along-track FOV 
(:math:`\theta_{AT}`) while the ``fieldOfViewGeometry.angleWidth`` corresponds to the cross-track FOV (:math:`\theta_{CT}`).

.. warning::   Some of the inputs are interdependent. The dependency **must** be satisfied by the values input by the user.
               The present version of the instrupy package does **not** check for the consistency of the values.

               Following relations between the inputs must be satisfied:

               *  Only square detectors are supported. Hence the IFOV of the detectors must be equal for the along-track 
                  and cross-track directions. This results in following relationship: 

                  :math:`\xi = \dfrac{\theta_{AT}}{N_{pix}^{AT}} = \dfrac{\theta_{CT}}{N_{pix}^{CT}} = \dfrac{d}{f}`

                  where,
                  :math:`\xi` is the instantaneous FOV or FOV per detector, 
                  :math:`\theta_{AT}` is the along-track (angular) FOV of the instrument,
                  :math:`\theta_{CT}` is the cross-track (angular) FOV of the instrument,
                  :math:`N_{pix}^{AT}` is the number of ground-pixels in along-track direction,
                  :math:`N_{pix}^{CT}` is the number of ground-pixels in cross-track direction,
                  :math:`d` is detector element length,
                  :math:`f` is the focal length.

               *  :math:`F\# = \dfrac{f}{D_{ap}}`

                  where,
                  :math:`F\#` is the F-number and :math:`D_{ap}` is the aperture diameter.

.. note:: Note there is difference between **ground-pixel** and **detectors**. Detectors refer to the actual physical discrete sensing elements on the scanner aperture. While ground-pixels refer 
             to the imaged pixels on the ground. The number of detectors in the cross-track direction will be less than the number of ground-pixels in the cross-track direction in case of Whiskbroom scanners.

Model results
------------------

Using the passive optical scanner model, coverage calculations (using the OrbitPy package) can be carried out over a region of interest. Coverage calculations which involve 
a grid (list of grid-points)) evaluate to see if the grid-points fall within the instrument sceneFOV (sceneFOV = FOV in most cases) or the FOR. The pointing-options feature further 
allows to automate coverage calculations for numerous instrument orientations. 

Once the coverage has been evaluated, the observable locations and the observer (satellite) locations is known. The following data metrics at the observable location 
on the surface of Earth can be calculated:

   ground pixel cross-track resolution [m] , float, meters, Spatial resolution of a hypothetical ground-pixel centered about observation point in the cross-track direction. 

.. note:: The simultaneous assumption of unit reflectance and blackbody to calculate the SNR is contradictory and can be troubling in spectral regions between the thermal and optical. 
          If the spectral region is in the IR or optical (where the radiative and reflective characteristics of Earth do not
          intersect), either of the radiated or the reflected energy is dominant, and the contradictory assumption is not troubling.  

Model description
------------------

Please refer to the references [1] and [2] for a more comprehensive description. Below text lays down the formulae coded into the model.

Viewing geometry
...................

The viewing geometry parameters, i.e. :math:`\mathbf{S}`, :math:`\mathbf{T}`, :math:`\mathbf{R}`, :math:`\theta_i` and :math:`\gamma` are determined using the setup 
described in :ref:`basic sensor model description<basic_sensor_model_desc>`.

Ground-pixel resolution calculations
......................................

Note that the current formulation is accurate only when ground-pixel is being imaged at the nadir or is at purely side-looking geometry.

:math:`\xi = \dfrac{d}{f}`

:math:`\rho_{CT} = \xi \dfrac{R}{\cos\theta_i}`

:math:`\rho_{AT} = \xi R`

.. todo:: Update for the general target geometry. 

Integration time calculation
......................................

The integration time is the period over which the detector is exposed to photons. There is an upper-bound that it has to be less than the access time which the instrument
shall have over a location (since the satellite is flying over the location, the access time is limited).
Let :math:`t_{acc}` be the total access time of the instrument over a ground-point. It can be calculated analytically as:
      
:math:`t_{acc} = \theta_{AT} \hspace{2mm} h/ v_g`

.. todo:: Update access time calculation for general target geometry. Above formulation is valid only for the nadir looking geometry or for purely sidelooking geometry.

*The available time for integration depends on the instrument scan-type and is given below:*

PUSHBROOM
===========
Only one detector row (in cross-track direction) is supported for pushbroom sensors. Hence the entire access time is available for integration.

:math:`T_i =  t_{acc}`

WHISKBROOM (Multielement)
==========================
Only one detector column (in along-track direction) supported for whiskbroom sensors. The integration time is a fraction of the access time and depend on the number of (ground) pixels
imaged in the cross-track direction.

:math:`T_i =  \dfrac{t_{acc}}{N_{pix}^{CT}}`

.. todo:: Note that :math:`t_{acc}` is calculated considering the :math:`\theta_{AT}` and not the :math:`\xi`.

MATRIX_IMAGER
==============
In case of the matrix imager each detector images separately a ground-pixel. Hence the entire access time is available for integration.

:math:`T_i =  t_{acc}`

**FInally,** if the calculated integration time is greater than the user-defined maximum detector exposure time, it is set to the user-defined maximum detector exposure
time.

:math:`if \hspace{2mm} T_i > T^{exp}_{max}, \hspace{2mm} T_i =  T^{exp}_{max}`

Calculation of signal electrons
......................................

Calculation of signal electrons involves calculation of the radiance from the Earth as a blackbody radiator and the radiance from the Earth as a reflector of Solar energy.

.. note:: The units of radiance used is [:math:`photons \hspace{1mm} s^{-1} \hspace{1mm} m^{-2} \hspace{1mm} sr^{-1}`]

Radiance with Earth as blackbody radiator
============================================

Assume Earth (body under observation) is a black-body and a Lambertian surface, i.e. the radiance
is independent of the angle. 

:math:`L_{E} = \int_{\lambda_1}^{\lambda_2} L_{\lambda} \tau_{\lambda}^{atm} \cos\theta_i`

where the spectral radiance is given from Plank's blackbody radiation equation,

:math:`L_{\lambda} = \dfrac{2 \Upsilon c^2}{\lambda^5} \dfrac{1}{\exp{\dfrac{\Upsilon c}{\lambda k_B T} - 1}}`

Radiance with Earth as reflector of Solar energy
=======================================================

Assume Sun is a blackbody with temperature 6000K. Also assumed is that the reflectance of the Earths surface is unity over all wavelengths in the operating band.

:math:`L_S =  \int_{\lambda_1}^{\lambda_2} L_{\lambda} \tau_{\lambda}^{atm}`

.. note:: :math:`\tau_{\lambda}^{atm}` here considers the two-way atmospheric losses, i.e. Sun to Ground and Ground to Satellite. 
          Strictly speaking the Ground to Satellite atmospheric loss appears separately, but mathematically either way the result
          is the same. In the present implementation framework it is easier to consider the term here since after this stage
          of calculation, the spectral information (energy per unit wavelength/frequency) is lost.

:math:`{\bf V_{Sun2T}} = {\bf T} - {\bf P_{Sun}}`

:math:`\theta_i^{Solar} = \cos^{-1}(\dfrac{{\bf T} \cdot -{\bf V_{Sun2T}}}{|{\bf T}||\bf V_{Sun2T}|})`

The *downwelling* term is used to refer to the energy from the Sun onto the surface, while the *upwelling* term is used to refer to the energy from the ground to the observer (sensor).

:math:`L^{dw}_S = L_S  \cos\theta_i^{Solar}`

:math:`A_{gp} = \rho_{CT} \rho_{AT}`

:math:`R^{dw}_S|_{ph} = L^{dw}_S A_{gp} \dfrac{\pi r_{Solar}^2}{|{\bf V_{Sun2T}}|^2}`
        
:math:`R^{uw}_S|_{ph} = R^{dw}_S|_{ph} \cos\theta_i`  (Unity reflectivity is assumed. Atmospheric loss had been accounted for before.)

:math:`L^{uw}_S = \dfrac{R^{uw}_S|_{ph}}{4 \pi A_{gp}}`
 
Radiance to Signal electrons calculation
============================================
The total radiance at the sensor detector is used to calculate the total number of photons and hence the total number of electrons accumulated at the detector.

:math:`L_T = L_{E} + L^{uw}_S`

:math:`R_T|_{ph} = L_T A_{gp}`

:math:`R^{sen}_T|_{ph} = \dfrac{R_T|_{ph}}{|{\bf R}|^2} (\dfrac{D_{ap}}{2})^2 \pi`

:math:`R^{det}_T|_{ph} = R^{sen}_T|_{ph} \tau_{op}`

:math:`N_{ph} = R^{det}_T|_{ph} T_i`

:math:`N_e = N_{ph} Q_E`

Calculation of signal-to-noise-ratio
......................................
Note that only shot-noise and read-noise is considered.

:math:`N_{sh} = \sqrt{N_e}`

:math:`N_t = \sqrt{N_n^2 + N_r^2}`

:math:`SNR = \dfrac{N_e}{N_t}`

Calculation of dynamic range
......................................
The dynamic range of the instrument is the quotient of signal- and read-out noise electrons the sensor sees between dark and bright scenes 
at the given reflection coefficient (here unity) of the target scene. 

:math:`DR = \dfrac{N_e}{N_r}`


Calculation of Noise-Equivalent Delta T
..........................................

Calculate number of signal electrons for a 1K raise in the temperature of observation pixel.

:math:`\Delta N = N_{e,new} - N_e`

:math:`NE\Delta T = \dfrac{N_e}{\Delta N}`
