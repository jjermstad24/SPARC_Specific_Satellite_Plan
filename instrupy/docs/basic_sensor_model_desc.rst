Basic Sensor Model
********************

The basic sensor model can be used to represent basic properties of an instrument: the field-of-view (FOV)/ scene-field-of-view (sceneFOV)/ field-of-regard (FOR)
and the orientation. Coverage (i.e. finding the locations which can be seen by the sensor) can be evaluated and viewing geometry parameters can calculated. 

The model also allows to configure a detector array geometry on a Focal Plane Array (FPA) which can be used to to simulate imagery by interpolating 
geo-physical data onto projected (ground) pixel positions.

Note that the coverage calculation and pixel-projection operations are available in the OrbitPy package.

Model parameters
------------------

A ``BasicSensorModel`` object can be obtained from a json/ dict by using the ``from_json(.)`` or ``from_dict(.)`` functions. The expected key/value
pairs are described below:

Model results
------------------

Using the basic-sensor model, coverage calculations (using the OrbitPy package) can be carried out over a region of interest. Coverage calculations which involve 
a grid (list of grid-points)) evaluate to see if the grid-points fall within the instrument sceneFOV (sceneFOV = FOV in most cases) or the FOR. The pointing-options feature further 
allows to automate coverage calculations for numerous instrument orientations. 

Once the coverage has been evaluated, the observable locations and the observer (satellite) locations is known. The following data metrics at the observable location 
on the surface of Earth can be calculated:

    :header: Metric,Data Type,Units,Description 
     
    incidence angle [deg], float,  degrees, Incidence-angle at the target point calculated assuming spherical Earth.
    look angle [deg], float,  degrees, Look-angle to the target point calculated assuming spherical Earth. Positive sign => look is in positive half-space made by the orbit-plane (i.e. orbit plane normal vector) and vice-versa.
    observation range [km], float, kilometers, Distance from satellite to ground-point during the observation. 
    solar zenith [deg], float, degrees, Solar-zenith-angle during observation.
