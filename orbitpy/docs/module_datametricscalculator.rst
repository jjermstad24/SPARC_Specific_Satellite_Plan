``orbitpy.datametricscalculator`` --- Data Metrics Calculator Module
======================================================================

Description
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This module provides classes and functions to handle observation data-metric calculations by invoking the :code:`instrupy` package. The module may be thought
of as a wrapper which passes in the relevant OrbitPy results (time of observation, target location, satellite-position) as inputs (along with the instrument object)
to the :class:`instrupy.base.Instrument.calc_data_metrics` function of the InstruPy module. 

An object of the class ``DataMetricsCalculator`` is be initialized for a particular spacecraft by passing the corresponding ``Spacecraft`` object and the filepath of the file
containing the spacecraft's propagated states.
The results of the coverage calculation (performed using any one of the coverage-calculators provided in the :class:`orbitpy.coveragecalculator` module) 
is also necessary for the data-metrics calculation. The access file locations, and the identifiers of the
instrument, mode corresponding to the coverage calculations is collected in the ``namedtuple`` object ``AccessFileInfo``. A list of ``AccessFileInfo`` objects
are passed as an input during the initialization of the ``DataMetricsCalculator`` object.


``DataMetricsCalculator.execute`` function
............................................
The ``execute`` function can be invoked on an ``DataMetricsCalculator`` object to calculate the data-metrics corresponding to each access. The
instrument, mode identifiers are to be provided so that the corresponding access-file can be selected for processing. 
The satellite state data is extracted from the satellite state file corresponding 
to the access-time of an access event. The target location at the access-time is available in the access data file. A ``DataMetricsOutputInfo`` object
containing meta-data about the results of the calculation is returned upon the successful execution of the ``execute`` function.

Output data file format
-------------------------
The format of the output data file is as follows:

*  The first row contains the coverage calculation type.
*  The second row containing the mission epoch in Julian Day UT1. The time (index) in the state data is referenced to this epoch.
*  The third row contains the time-step size in seconds. 
*  The fourth row contains the duration (in days) for which the data-metrics calculation is done.
*  The fifth row contains the columns headers and the sixth row onwards contains the corresponding data. 

Note that time associated with a row is:  ``time = epoch (in JDUT1) + time-index * time-step-size (in secs) * (1/86400)`` 

Description of the csv data is given below:

.. csv-table:: Observation data metrics description
   :header: Column, Data type, Units, Description
   :widths: 10,10,10,30

   time index, int, , Access time-index.
   GP index, int, , Grid-point index. 
   pnt-opt index, int, , Pointing options index.
   lat [deg], float, degrees, Latitude corresponding to the GP index/ pnt-opt index.
   lon [deg], float, degrees, Longitude in corresponding to the GP index/ pnt-opt index.

Other columns containing the data-metrics specific to the instrument type are present. Refer to the docs of the corresponding instrument type (in ``instrupy`` package)
for description of the evaluated data-metrics.

Examples
^^^^^^^^^

1. In the below code snippet a spacecraft with two instruments with ids *bs1* and *bs2* is initialized. Grid based coverage calculations are first carried out
   for *bs1*. A datametrics calculator object is initialized with the spacecraft object, state file and the access-file info corresponding to *bs1*. The 
   data-metrics calculator is executed to give the results in the file *bs1_datametrics.csv*.

   The coverage calculations for *bs2* is then carried out and the corresponding access-file info is added to the data-metrics calculator object. The 
   data-metrics calculator is executed to give the results in the file *bs2_datametrics.csv*.
