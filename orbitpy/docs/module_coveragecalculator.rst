``orbitpy.coveragecalculator`` --- Coverage Calculator
===========================================================

Description
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Module providing classes and functions to handle coverage related calculations. Factory method pattern is used for initializing the coverage calculator 
object (please see :ref:`module_constellation` for details). The module provides for three types of coverage calculations which are described in detail below.
Users may additionally define their own coverage calculator classes adherent to the same interface functions 
(``from_dict(.)``, ``to_dict(.)``, ``execute(.)``, ``__eq__(.)``) as in any of the built in coverage calculator classes.

.. _grid_cov_desc:

*GRID COVERAGE* 
----------------

The *GRID COVERAGE* type of coverage calculation involves finding the access-times of a spacecraft over a region represented by a grid. Each ``GridCoverage`` object is specific to 
a particular grid and spacecraft. The class instance is initialized using the grid object, spacecraft object and path to a data file containing the satellite propagated orbit-states. 
The format of the input data file of the spacecraft states is the same as the format of the output data file of the 
:class:`orbitpy.propagator` module (see :ref:`module_propagator`). The states must be of the type ``CARTESIAN_EARTH_CENTERED_INERTIAL``.

``GridCoverage.execute`` function
..................................

The coverage calculation can be executed using the ``execute(.)`` function. The instrument (in the spacecraft) and the mode of the instrument can be specified 
by means of their respective identifiers (in the ``instru_id``, ``mode_id`` input arguments). If not specified, the first instrument in the list of spacecraft's instruments, the first mode of the instrument (see the docs of :class:`instrupy.base.Instrument`)
in the list of modes of the instrument shall be selected. 

Coverage is calculated for the period over which the input spacecraft propagated states are available. The time-resolution of the coverage calculation is the same as the time resolution at which the spacecraft states are available.
Note that the sceneFOV of an instrument (which may be the same as the instrument FOV) is used for coverage calculations unless it has been specified to use the field-of-regard (using the ``use_field_of_regard`` input argument).

The ``mid_access_only`` input argument can be used to specify if the access times only at the middle of an continuous access-interval. 
E.g. If the access takes place at time-indices 450, 451, 452, 453, 454, and if the ``mid_access_only`` flag is specified to be true, then only the access time-index = 452 is written
in the results.
Please see :ref:`correction_of_access_files` for situations when the ``mid_access_only`` flag would need to be set true.

The ``out_file_access`` input argument is 
used to specify the filepath (with filename) at which the results are to be written.

Three coverage methods (relevant for the case of sensor FOVs described by spherical-polygon vertices and Rectangular FOVs) can be 
specified: (1) ``DirectSphericalPIP`` or (2) ``ProjectedPIP`` or (3) ``RectangularPIP``. 
Default method is ``DirectSphericalPIP``.
The ``DirectSphericalPIP`` method is based on a point in spherical polygon algorithm described in the article: 
*R. Ketzner, V. Ravindra and M. Bramble, 'A Robust, Fast, and Accurate Algorithm for Point in Spherical Polygon Classification with Applications in Geoscience and Remote Sensing', Computers and Geosciences, accepted.*

A ``CoverageOutputInfo`` object containing meta-info about the results is returned at the end of execution of the function.

.. _grid_coverage_output_file_format:

Output data file format
.........................

The output of executing the coverage calculator is a csv data file containing the access data.

*  The first row contains the coverage calculation type.
*  The second row containing the mission epoch in Julian Day UT1. The time (index) in the state data is referenced to this epoch.
*  The third row contains the time step-size in seconds. 
*  The fourth row contains the duration (in days) for which coverage calculation is executed.
*  The fifth row contains the columns headers and the sixth row onwards contains the corresponding data. 

Note that time associated with a row is:  ``time = epoch (in JDUT1) + time-index * time-step-size (in secs) * (1/86400)`` 

Description of the columns headers and data is given below:

.. csv-table:: Coverage data description
      :header: Column, Data type, Units, Description
      :widths: 10,10,10,30

      time index, int, , Access time-index.
      GP index, int, , Grid-point index.
      lat [deg], float, degrees, Latitude corresponding to the GP index.
      lon [deg], float, degrees, Longitude corresponding to the GP index.

.. _pointing_opt_cov_desc:

*POINTING OPTIONS COVERAGE*
----------------------------

This type of coverage calculations is possible for an instrument (on a spacecraft) with a set of pointing-options.
A pointing-option refers to orientation of the instrument in the nadir-pointing frame. The set of pointing-options 
represent all the possible orientations of the instrument due to maneuverability of the instrument and/or satellite-bus.
The ground-locations for each pointing-option, at each propagation time-step is calculated as the coverage result.

The class instance is initialized using the spacecraft object and path to a data file containing the satellite propagated orbit-states. 
The format of the input data file of the spacecraft states is the same as the format of the output data file of the 
:class:`orbitpy.propagator` module (see :ref:`module_propagator`). The states must be of the type ``CARTESIAN_EARTH_CENTERED_INERTIAL``.

``PointingOptionsCoverage.execute`` function
...............................................

The coverage calculation can be executed using the ``execute(.)`` function. The instrument and the mode of the instrument (in the spacecraft) can be specified 
by means of their respective identifiers (in the ``instru_id``, ``mode_id`` input arguments). If not specified, the first instrument in the list of spacecraft's instruments, the first mode of the instrument (see the docs of :class:`instrupy.base.Instrument`)
in the list of modes of the instrument shall be selected.
A ``CoverageOutputInfo`` object containing meta-info about the results is returned at the end of execution of the function.

.. _pointing_options_coverage_output_file_format:

Output data file format
.........................

The output of executing the coverage calculator is a csv data file containing the access data.

*  The first row contains the coverage calculation type.
*  The second row containing the mission epoch in Julian Day UT1. The time (index) in the state data is referenced to this epoch.
*  The third row contains the time-step size in seconds. 
*  The fourth row contains the duration (in days) for which coverage calculation is executed.
*  The fifth row contains the columns headers and the sixth row onwards contains the corresponding data. 

Note that time associated with a row is:  ``time = epoch (in JDUT1) + time-index * time-step-size (in secs) * (1/86400)`` 

Description of the columns headers and data is given below:

.. csv-table:: Coverage data description
      :header: Column, Data type, Units, Description
      :widths: 10,10,10,30

      time index, int, , Access time-index.
      pnt-opt index, int, , "Pointing options index. The indexing starts from 0, where 0 is the first pointing-option in the list of instrument pointing-options."
      lat [deg], float, degrees, Latitude of accessed ground-location.
      lon [deg], float, degrees, Longitude of accessed ground-location.

.. _pointing_options_with_grid_coverage_output_file_format:

*POINTING OPTIONS WITH GRID COVERAGE*
--------------------------------------

This type of coverage calculations is similar to the :ref:`grid_cov_desc`, except that the coverage calculations are carried out for the list of pointing-options
(see :ref:`pointing_opt_cov_desc`) available for an instrument. 

``PointingOptionsWithGridCoverage.execute`` function
.......................................................

The function behavior is similar to the ``execute`` function of the ``GridCoverage`` object. Coverage calculations are performed for a specific instrument and mode,
and the results are written out for separately for each pointing-option of the instrument/mode. 
A key difference is that only the scene-field-of-view of the instrument is considered (no scope to use field-of-regard) in the coverage calculation. 

Output data file format
.........................

The output of executing the coverage calculator is a csv data file containing the access data.

*  The first row contains the coverage calculation type.
*  The second row containing the mission epoch in Julian Day UT1. The time (index) in the state data is referenced to this epoch.
*  The third row contains the time-step size in seconds. 
*  The fourth row contains the duration (in days) for which coverage calculation is executed.
*  The fifth row contains the columns headers and the sixth row onwards contains the corresponding data. 

Note that time associated with a row is:  ``time = epoch (in JDUT1) + time-index * time-step-size (in secs) * (1/86400)`` 

Description of the columns headers and data is given below:

.. csv-table:: Coverage data description

      GP index, int, , Grid-point index.
      lat [deg], float, degrees, Latitude corresponding to the GP index.
      lon [deg], float, degrees, Longitude corresponding to the GP index.

.. _correction_of_access_files:

*Correction* of access files for purely side-looking instruments with narrow along-track FOV
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In case of purely side-looking instruments with narrow-FOV (eg: SARs executing Stripmap operation mode), the access to a grid-point takes place
when the grid-point is seen with no squint angle and the access is almost instantaneous (i.e. access duration is very small). 
The coverage calculations is carried out with the corresponding instrument scene-field-of-view or field-of-regard (built using the scene-field-of-view) 
(see :code:`instrupy` package documentation). 
If the instrument FOV is to be used for coverage calculations, a *very very* small time step-size would need to be used which to impractically leads to long computation time.

The access files in general list rows of access-time, ground-points, and thus independent access opportunities for the instrument
when the scene-field-of-view / field-of-regard is used for coverage calculations. 
If the generated access files from the these coverage calculations of a purely side-looking, narrow along-track FOV instrument is
interpreted in the same manner, it would be erroneous.

Thus the generated access files are then *corrected* to show access only at approximately (to the nearest propagation time-step) 
the middle of the access interval. 
This should be coupled with the required scene-scan-duration (from scene-field-of-view) to get complete information about the access. 

For example, consider a SAR instrument pointing sideways as shown in the figure below. The along-track FOV is narrow
corresponding to narrow strips, and a scene is built from concatenated strips. A SceneFOV is associated with the SAR and is used for access 
calculation over the grid point shown in the figure. Say the propagation time-step is 1s as shown in the figure. An access interval between
t=100s to t=105s is registered. However as shown the actual access takes place over a small interval of time at t=103.177s. 

An approximation can be applied (i.e. correction is made) that the observation time of the ground point is at the middle of the access
interval as calculated using the SceneFOV, rounded of to the nearest propagation time, i.e. :math:`t= 100 + ((105-100)/2) % 1 = 103s`. The state 
of the spacecraft at :math:`t=103s` and access duration corresponding to the instrument FOV (note: *not* the sceneFOV) (can be determined analytically) 
is to be used for the data-metrics calculation.

.. figure:: sar_access.png
      :scale: 75 %
      :align: center

.. warning:: The correction method is to be used only when the instrument access-duration (which is determined from the instrument FOV) is smaller 
            than the propagation time step (which is determined from the sceneFOV or FOR).

*SPECULAR COVERAGE* 
--------------------

The *SPECULAR COVERAGE* type of coverage calculation involves calculation of specular points/regions of a receiver spacecraft (with reflectometer as the instrument).
Each ``SpecularCoverage`` object is specific to a receiver spacecraft, list of source (transmitter) spacecrafts and an (optional) grid.
Specular points at each propagation time step are calculated between the receiver spacecraft and all the source spacecrafts. 
If a grid is specified, the set of grid points falling within a circular region (of user-specified diameter) about the specular point, is also calculated during the coverage execution.

The class instance is initialized using the receiver and source (>=1) spacecraft objects and path to the data files containing the propagated orbit-states of the spacecrafts.
The format of the input data file of the spacecraft states is the same as the format of the output data file of the 
:class:`orbitpy.propagator` module (see :ref:`module_propagator`). The states must be of the type ``CARTESIAN_EARTH_CENTERED_INERTIAL``.
In the state files, the epoch, propagation time resolution, must be the same across all the spacecrafts (receiver and source).
A grid object may also be specified during the class instantiation.

``SpecularCoverage.execute`` function
.......................................

The coverage calculation can be executed using the ``execute(.)`` function. The instrument (in the spacecraft) and the mode of the instrument can be specified 
by means of their respective identifiers (in the ``instru_id``, ``mode_id`` input arguments). If not specified, the first instrument in the list of spacecraft's instruments, the first mode of the instrument (see the docs of :class:`instrupy.base.Instrument`)
in the list of modes of the instrument shall be selected. Note that the sceneFOV of an instrument (which may be the same as the instrument FOV) is used for coverage calculations.
If no instrument present in spacecraft the entire horizon as seen by the receiving satellite is considered for the coverage calculations (however this does not work when grid based calculations are required, see the TODO below). 

The transmitter spacecraft is assumed to transmit the RF signal over it's entire visible horizon.

Coverage is calculated for the period over which the receiver, source spacecraft propagated states are available. 
The time-resolution of the coverage calculation is the same as the time resolution at which the spacecraft states are available.

If a grid has been specified (during the instantiation by the ``grid`` instance variable), and the diameter of the specular region has been specified (through the ``specular_region_dia`` input parameter),
then the grid points which are present within the specular region are found and written in the file specified by the ``out_file_grid_access`` parameter. The specular region is 
approximated to be circular in shape with the calculated specular point as the center, and the diameter specified by the ``specular_region_dia`` input parameter.

In case of sensor FOVs described by spherical-polygon vertices or Rectangular FOVs, a ``method`` can be specifies which specifies the method to be used to:

*     evaluate if a specular location is within the sensor FOV or not and,
*     for grid based calculations 

Refer to the ``execute`` function of the ``GridCoverage`` object for description of available methods.

.. todo:: When grid is specified, the sensor **must** be present, else a `NotImplementedError` is thrown. Modify this behaviour so 
          that the coverage calculations with grid can be carried out considering the entire horizon to be within the satellite FOV.

The figure below is a rough flowchart of the steps involved in the specular coverage for a receiver, source spacecraft pair:

.. figure:: specular_cov_algo.png
      :scale: 75 %
      :align: center

The ``out_file_specular`` and ``out_file_grid_access`` input arguments are used to specify the filepaths (with filename) at which the results are to be written.

A ``CoverageOutputInfo`` object containing meta-info about the results is returned at the end of execution of the function.

.. _specular_coverage_output_file_format:

Output data file format
.........................

The output of executing the coverage calculator is a csv data file containing the specular locations and another csv file containting the grid points 
falling within the specular region (if a grid and the specular region diameters have been specified).

The csv file containing the specular locations has the following format:

*  The first row contains the coverage calculation type.
*  The second row containing the mission epoch in Julian Day UT1. The time (index) in the state data is referenced to this epoch.
*  The third row contains the time-step size in seconds.
*  The fourth row contains the duration (in days) for which coverage calculation is executed.
*  The fifth row contains the columns headers and the sixth row onwards contains the corresponding data. 

Note that time associated with a row is: ``time = epoch (in JDUT1) + time-index * time-step-size (in secs) * (1/86400)`` 

Description of the coverage data is given below:

.. csv-table:: Coverage data description

Examples

1. *GRID COVERAGE example 1*
   
   The following snippet of code initializes and executes coverage calculation for a spacecraft in an equatorial orbit, and a grid about the
   equator. The spacecraft is aligned to the nadir-pointing frame (:class:`instrupy.util.ReferenceFrame.NADIR_POINTING`) and the instrument in turn is
   aligned to the spacecraft body frame (:class:`instrupy.util.ReferenceFrame.SC_BODY_FIXED`). The access data shows the grid-points accessed at every time tick
   of the mission. The interval between the time-ticks is equal to the propagation step-size which here is 2 seconds.

4. *POINTING OPTIONS WITH GRID COVERAGE example*
   
      In the below snippet, the satellite is equipped with two instruments. The second instrument with the pointing-options specifications is chosen for
      coverage calculations.  The ``mid_access_only`` flag is set to ``True`` to have only the access-times at the middle of access-intervals. The output csv file
      shows the grid-points accessed (if any) for each of the pointing-options at every time-step.

5. *SPECULAR COVERAGE example*
   
      The example shows calculation of specular points and also grid based access calculations involving three transmitter satellites (Navstar 79, 80 and 81),
      and a receiver satellite equipped with a 45 deg x 45 deg rectangular FOV sensor. Two files `test_specular_access.csv` and `test_grid_access.csv` are written.
      A 50km diameter is specified as the dimension of the specular region.
