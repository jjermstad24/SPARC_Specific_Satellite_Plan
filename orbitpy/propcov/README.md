# PROPCOV

The `propcov` package consists of C++ source files bound with python using `pybind11`. The C++ classes and functions
are made available as python objects to be used by the `orbitpy` package.

## Use of `pybind11` for binding C++ with python

`pybind11 version 2.6.2` is used to bind the C++ source to python. It uses CMake for the build process.

https://pybind11.readthedocs.io/en/stable/basics.html

The directory structure and build is based on the *cmake_example* git-repo available in https://github.com/pybind/cmake_example.

The file `src/main.cpp` contains the python bindings of the C++ classes which are used by OrbitPy. Note that not all the available C++
classes are bound.

### Notes

* `cmake`, `gcc` are primary requirements.

* The primary work needed to utilize `pybind11` requires inclusion, modifications of the following:

    * The `pybind11` source folder in `propcov/extern/`
    
    * The `CMakeLists.txt` in the `propcov` folder and other subfolders where the C++ source files are located. 

    * The `pyproject.toml` file in the `propcov` folder.

    * The `setup.py` file in the `propcov` folder.

* The `propcov/src/main.cpp` source file contains the binding code of the C++ sources. Note that *not* all the C++ source is currently bound.

* When the `propcov` package is installed a `build` folder and `***.so` library file is created along with `***.egg-info`. These must be deleted in the un-installation process so as to allow for smooth re-installation.

* The `Makefile` present in the `propcov` folder is to facilitate easy installation, cleanup of the `propcov` package. I.e. when `make` is run from the `propcov` directory, the propcov library is installed.

* The Makefiles in the `extern/gmatutil/`, `lib/propcov-cpp/` are to facilitate a separate build process (not associated with `cmake`). The builds are triggered when running the Makefile in the `tests/` folder. This allows for independent build of the C++ sources (not associated with the python binding provided by Pybind11).

## Installation

**Requires:** Unix-like operating system, `python 3.8`, `pip`, `gcc`, `cmake`.

`pybind11` 

**To install:** Run `make` from the main git directory.

### Issues in MacOS

In case of MacOS, there may arise a errors due to wrong compiler selection. This is the case if the following lines are displayed in the traceback log (in the console) during the `propcov` installation:

```
-- The C compiler identification is AppleClang 11.0.3.11030032
-- The CXX compiler identification is AppleClang 11.0.3.11030032
```

Instead of Clang compiler, GCC needs to be used.  For more details please refer to: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24380456/how-can-i-make-cmake-use-gcc-instead-of-clang-on-mac-os-x 

Possible solutions

1. Try the below line (in the Mac terminal) before running the installation:

```
export CC=gcc 
```

2. Install specific version of `gcc` and then set the compiler selection in the `CMakeLists.txt` file.

For example install `gcc-11` using the command `brew install gcc@11`

Then add the below lines to the `propcov/CMakeLists.txt` file.

``` 
# THIS HAS TO COME BEFORE THE PROJECT LINE
set(CMAKE_C_COMPILER "gcc-11")
set(CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER "g++-11")
# THIS HAS TO COME BEFORE THE PROJECT LINE
```

Then run the installation.

## Tests

The folder `tests/test-cpp/` contains C++ tests of the `propcov` C++ classes. GoogleTest (GTest) library is used and must be installed to run the tests. [This link](https://www.eriksmistad.no/getting-started-with-google-test-on-ubuntu/) provides good tutorial on installing GTest in Ubuntu.

To run the tests navigate to `tests/` folder and run `make all` followed by `make runtest`.

Running `make all` from the `tests` directory shall trigger clean-up and build of the sources in the `extern/gmatutil` folder and the `lib/propcov-cpp` folder. The test-files in the `tests/test-cpp` folder are built and the executables written in the `tests/build` folder. The executables can be run one after another using the `make runtest` command. 

## Build system
There are two build systems within the `propcov` folder.

**Build system 1**

This build system is used during the normal course of the package installation. It is invoked by running `make` from the root folder. The `make` command executes the python installation (via the `setup.py` file) which in turn invokes `cmake` commands. The python package is installed, and it can be imported like any other package within a python script using the command `import propcov`.

It is associated with the following files:

* `./Makefile`
* `./setup.py`
* `./CMakeLists.txt`
* `./pyproject.toml`
* `./../lib/propcov-cpp/CMakeLists.txt`
* `./../extern/gmatutil/CMakeLists.txt`
* `./../extern/pybind11/CMakeLists.txt`

The following folders (and files within) are created during the build process:

* `./build/`
* `./propcov.egg-info/`

Examples of similar build systems which are meant for python bound C++ libraries using Pybind11 are as follows:

* [https://github.com/sizmailov/pybind11-project-example](https://github.com/sizmailov/pybind11-project-example)
* [https://github.com/pybind/python_example](https://github.com/pybind/python_example)

**Build system 2**

This build system is used to generate the object files for running standalone C++ tests. It is invokes by running `make` inside the `./tests/` folder. It creates the C++ objects files in the source directories and the test executables in the `./build/` folder. 

It is associated with the following files:
* `./tests/Makefile`
* `./../lib/propcov-cpp/Makefile`
* `./../extern/gmatutil/Makefile`

The following files are created during the build process

* `./../lib/propcov-cpp/libpropcov.a`
* Various object files associated with the files with `.cpp` extension in the `./../lib/propcov-cpp/` folder and subfolders.
* `./../extern/gmatutil/libgmatutil.a`
* Various object files associated with the files with `.cpp` extension in the `./../extern/gmatutil/` folder and subfolders.
* Object files, dependency files and executables inside the `./tests/build/` folder relating to the test programs.

```

The `gmatutil` folder is a copy of the same folder from the GMAT2020a repository, except:

1. The `util/datawriter` folder was removed.
2. The `gmatutil/base` folder was added containing `ExponentialAtmosphere.hpp` and `ExponentialAtmosphere.cpp` files.
3. Addition of `gmatdefs.cpp` file in the `gmatutil/include` folder.
4. The CMakeLists.txt file was revised according to the changes 1,2 and additional removals (see the file for details).
5. The CmakeLists.txt was modifed to output a static library with target-name `GmatUtil` with the flags `POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE ON`.

## Documentation

The `docs/propcov-cpp.doc` contains description of the `lib\propocov-cpp\` C++ classes.

The `docs/tatc_docs` contains **old** (March 2019) documentation of most of the `lib\propocov-cpp\` C++ classes which was developed during the course of the TAT-C project. Note that some of the classes referred to in the documentation might have changed since the docs  was made.

## Known Issues

* Passing `propcov` objects as arguments in functions shows *pass-by-reference* C++ behavior.

    Modification of the `propcov` objects within the function to which they have been passed *seems* to result in modification of the parent 
    object outside the function, i.e. it is a pass-by-reference. This behavior is to still confirmed and investigated. 

    In order to bypass this undesired behavior, a copy of the original argument is made within the function and the copy is used. Example in the `orbitpy.propagator.J2AnalyticalPropagator.execute(.)` function, the following snippet is used to make a copy of the `start_date` function argument.

    ```
    _start_date = propcov.AbsoluteDate()
    _start_date.SetJulianDate(start_date.GetJulianDate())
    ```

    Also note that in order to make a deep-copy, we need to initialize a new object with the same object parameters as the original object as seen in the above example.
