Class Definitions for Point in Spherical Polygon Algorithm
----------------------------------------------------------

-------
Polygon
-------

The Polygon class is a pure virtual class which defines the interface for spherical polygons. This 
interface requires all child classes to implement a function which takes query point coordinates as
input and returns an integer value representing point inclusion status in the polygon. The Polygon
file also includes a util namespace defining some useful function used across the program (spherical
/cartesian coordinate conversion, file i.o., etc.). 

------------
Preprocessor
------------

The preprocessor class is a pure virtual class which defines the interface for preprocessing algorithms.
This interface requires all child classes to implement a method which returns a list of indices representing
a subset of edges to be examined as a function of the query point coordinates.

-------------
SlicedPolygon
-------------

A child class of Polygon which implements the proposed point in spherical polygon algorithm. The 
algorithm can be run with or without preprocessing. To run with preprocessing, a Preprocessor object
must be added using the addPreprocessor method. 

----
Edge
----

A utility class to simplify representation of polygon edges across the program. The edge class is
constructed with two coordinate points, and implements useful functions such as checking whether a 
given query point meets necessary strike or the hemisphere check with respect to the edge.

----------
SliceArray
----------
The proposed preprocessing algorithm described in the paper. The class is constructted using an 
array of vertex longitudes in the query frame. The preprocess() method is used to run the preprocessing
routine after construction. The getEdges takes method takes the coordinates of a query point as input and 
returns the subset of edges classified in the leaf slice containing the query point.

---------
SliceTree
---------
This class implements the old version of the preprocessing algorithm using the recursive spacial 
subdivision technique.

--------------
PointInPolygon
--------------
Utility class for running the algorithm from the command line and generating point inclusion and 
runtime report output files.
