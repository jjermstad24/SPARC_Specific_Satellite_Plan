/**
 * Definition of the CoverageChecker class.  This class checks for point
 * coverage. The class is a reduced version of 'CoverageCheckerLegacy'. While the
 * legacy version includes functionality to generate reports, this class only checks for 
 * point-coverage.
 * 
 * The CoverageChecker is instantiated with pointers to PointGroup object and a Spacecraft object.
 * The point-group contains list of points which are to be checked for coverage calculations. 
 * The spacecraft may contain sensor, in which case coverage is evaluated for the sensor FOV or if no sensor
 * the coverage is evaluated for the spacecraft (horizon-test is performed). There is room to expand to multiple sensors
 * per spacecraft, but currently only 1 sensor per spacecraft is allowed.
 * 
 * The primary functions utilized are the overloaded functions CheckPointCoverage(.). First the CheckGridFeasibility(.) function is invoked
 * to (1) determine if spacecraft and point are on the same hemisphere (2) if 1 is true, horizon check is performed. 
 * The above tests check the feasibility of point being covered. If feasible, the point is evaluated to be within/out of the sensor FOV.
 *
